# Battleship
A 3D unity game modeled after the classic game Battleship

## Setup
1. Install Unity (Written with Unity v. 2017.3.1f1)
2. Clone the Battleship GIT repository
3. Open Battleship as a Unity Project

## How to Play:
1. Check ToggleShip (Located at the top left of screen).
2. You have five ships of sizes 3, 5, 4, 2, and 2 in that order of placement. Set the location of the tail-end of your ship (its initial direction is toward the right). You can rotate clockwise by increments of 90 degrees.
3. Repeat for each of your five ships.
4. Check ToggleFire (Located at the top right-half of the screen).
5. Select a location and click Fire. A miss is marked by an 'O' and a hit is marked by an 'X'. If an enemy ship is destroyed, the Ships Destroyed counter increments. If one of your ships is destroyed the Ships Lost counter increments.
